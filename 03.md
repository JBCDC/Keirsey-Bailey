# Keirsey’s personality types

**Keirsey’s 16 Personality Types**

David Keirsey's 16 personality types, derived from Carl Jung's psychological types and popularized through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), provide a comprehensive framework for understanding individual differences in human behavior, cognition, and emotion. These types are organized around four core temperaments: Guardian (SJ), Artisan (SP), Rational (NT), and Idealist (NF). Each temperament comprises four distinct types, resulting in a total of 16 unique personality profiles.

1. Guardians (SJ): Comprising of ESTJ, ESFJ, ISTJ, and ISFJ, Guardians are characterized by their conscientiousness, practicality, and respect for traditions. They value security, stability, and community, and they excel in roles that require organization, responsibility, and attention to detail.

2. Artisans (SP): Including ESTP, ESFP, ISTP, and ISFP, Artisans are spontaneous, adaptable, and focused on the here and now. They are drawn to sensory experiences and enjoy living life to the fullest. They tend to be action-oriented, hands-on learners who are at their best when they can use their resourcefulness and adaptability to solve problems.

3. Rationals (NT): Comprising of ENTJ, ENTP, INTJ, and INTP, Rationals are strategic, analytical, and objective. They value knowledge, competence, and logical consistency, and they excel in roles that require problem-solving, conceptual thinking, and innovation.

4. Idealists (NF): Including ENFJ, ENFP, INFJ, and INFP, Idealists are intuitive, empathetic, and value-driven. They seek meaning and purpose in their lives and relationships, and they excel in roles that allow them to inspire, motivate, and counsel others.

Let's delve a bit deeper into each type:

- ESTJ (The Supervisor): Grounded in reality and pragmatic, they are natural leaders who value order, structure, and efficiency.
- ESFJ (The Provider): Warm and cooperative, they are driven by a sense of duty and a desire to help and support others.
- ISTJ (The Inspector): Dependable and methodical, they have a keen eye for detail and a commitment to upholding standards and traditions.
- ISFJ (The Protector): Compassionate and dedicated, they are motivated by a need to care for and protect others.
- ESTP (The Promoter or Dynamo): Energetic and pragmatic, they are adept at responding to immediate challenges with practical solutions.
- ESFP (The Performer): Outgoing and spontaneous, they are drawn to new experiences and enjoy engaging with the world in a playful, creative manner.
- ISTP (The Craftsman): Independent and observant, they excel at understanding how things work and solving practical problems.
- ISFP (The Composer): Gentle and sensitive, they appreciate beauty and harmony and often express themselves through creative pursuits.
- ENTJ (The Commander): Strategic and assertive, they are natural leaders with a clear vision and a plan for achieving their goals.
- ENTP (The Visionary): Innovative and intellectually curious, they enjoy exploring new ideas and possibilities.
- INTJ (The Mastermind): Analytical and strategic, they have a natural ability to comprehend complex theoretical and abstract concepts.
- INTP (The Architect): Thoughtful and philosophical, they are driven by a desire to understand the fundamental principles of the universe.
- ENFJ (The Teacher): Charismatic and inspiring, they have a natural ability to motivate and mobilize others.
- ENFP (The Champion): Enthusiastic and imaginative, they are driven by a desire to explore new possibilities and to make a positive impact on the world.

Each of these types offers a unique perspective and a distinctive set of strengths and potentials. By understanding these types, we can gain a deeper appreciation of human diversity, foster more effective communication and collaboration, and promote personal growth and self-realization.

<br>

According to [Career Planner](https://careerplanner.com/MB2/TypeInPopulation-Males-Females.cfm), 47% of the population is Guardian, 17% Idealist, 10% Rational and 27% Artisan. Males comprise 20% of the Rationals compared with only 9% for females. On the other hand, more Idealists are females (22%) compared 14% in males. Artisans are evenly divided. Therefore, the T/F axis does differentiate males from females, probably due to differences in preferences in using abstract language. However, females appear to be overrepresented among Provider (ESFJ) and Protector (ISFJ) Guardians, both with a strong T function. All percentages are approximations and may not add to 100% due to rounding error.

This analysis provides an intriguing perspective on the distribution of Keirsey's four main temperament types, both generally and across genders. According to these data from CareerPlanner, it appears that Guardians represent the largest group in the population at 45%, followed by Artisans at 23%, Idealists at 17%, and Rationals at 14%.

When examining the distribution by gender, interesting patterns emerge. Rationals are more prevalent among males (20%) than females (9%), while the reverse is true for Idealists, who are more common among females (22%) compared to males (14%). This seems to suggest that the Thinking/Feeling axis might differentiate males from females.

However, the picture becomes more complex when you consider that females appear to be overrepresented among Provider and Protector Guardians (STJ), both of which involve a strong Thinking function. This indicates that it may not be the isolated Thinking function that differentiates males from females, but rather the use of concrete versus abstract language.

Moreover, the data suggests that females outscore males in cooperation versus utilitarianism in the action axis of the Keirsey Temperament matrix, pointing to further nuances in the interplay between personality traits and gender.

These findings, while thought-provoking, should be interpreted with caution due to the inherent limitations of self-reported personality assessments and potential rounding errors. Nonetheless, they offer valuable insights into the complex dynamics of personality and gender, underscoring the need for further research in this area.
