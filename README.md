**The 7 Bailey Ray Types Correlated with Keirsey's 4 Temperaments and 16 Personality Types**

The construct validity of the seven psychological types posited by Alice A. Bailey serves as an intriguing subject for exploration, especially when contrasted with the well-established Myers-Briggs typology adapted by David Keirsey. The Four Keirsey Temperaments—Artisan, Rational, Idealist, and Guardian—demonstrate a striking congruence with the Four Derivative Rays of Attributes—Fourth Ray of Harmony Through Conflict, Fifth Ray of Science, Sixth Ray of Devotion and Idealism, and the Seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order—originating from the Three Primary Rays of Aspect: First Ray of Will Power, Second Ray of Love Wisdom, and Third Ray of Creative Intelligence.

This compelling concordance, observed by the author 25 years ago, initiated this theoretical research endeavor. Currently, the congruence between these two typologies can be examined through a virtual Delphi method, facilitated by artificial intelligence. This method allows for a consensus to be drawn from a pool of knowledge, which in this case, is provided by an AI model trained in both typologies. This draft is a collection of queries and curated AI answers, encouraging others to its free use, modification, and distribution, under the principles of openness, collaboration, and innovation, as long as they credit any original material and license any new creations under identical terms for non-commercial purposes only.   

The main conclusions of this study are:

1. The internal consistency of the construct of the Seven Rays as three primordial y four derivative vectors. The orthogonality of three primordial rays would correspond to the three primary colors of light, out of which all other colors can be derived according to the theory of color. However, the correspondence of the four derivative rays, as established in the esoteric literature (Blatavatsky-Bailey), with the secondary and tertiary complementary colors of light does not always follow the rules of the additive color model, except for Ray 6 (cyan). More theoretical work and empirical validation is needed.

2. The high theoretical correlation of the four main Keirsey temperaments with the four Bailey derivative rays was confirmed by contrasting the traits of the 16 Keirsey types. Furthermore, the expected 1-3-5-7 and 2-4-6 pattern of the seven rays clearly emerged for the Keirsey rational and idealist types. The pattern was more nuanced for the Guardian and the Artisan types.

3. The proposed JB model, theoretically correlating the four Keirsey temperaments with the 7 rays, could be useful for a first approximation to rapidly ascertain the rays in the psychological constitution of clients, as well as the basis for further empirical validation, that is, estimating statistical correlations of questionnaires addressing both typologies.

4. The usefulness of AI for the theoretical exploration of instruments addressing personality types.

5. The identification of possible future subjects of research correlating the 7 rays with the fields of music, astrology (the four elements) and the periodic table of chemistry. 

It’s crucial to acknowledge that this is a purely theoretical approach to the subject. However, it’s worth noting that theoretical physics has often paved the way for empirical discoveries, predicting the existence of subatomic particles before they were experimentally verified. In a similar vein, this initial exploration might serve as a foundation for subsequent theoretical and empirical research. The goal would be to validate with the 7-rays construct what has already been revealed through the study of sound (music) and light (color): a sevenfold key to unraveling the complexities of evolution and human consciousness. -JB 2023.09.25
